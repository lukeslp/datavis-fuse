NASA GISTEMP global temperature anomaly data from 1880 to 2025, rendered as a particle system. It starts measured and cold. It does not stay that way.

## What it does

Each monthly temperature reading spawns particles whose color and physics are driven by the anomaly value for that month. Cool anomalies produce slow, blue-tinted particles that drift downward. Warm anomalies produce fast, orange-to-red particles that surge upward. The current year and temperature reading are displayed large in the center.

The animation plays forward through 140+ years of data. You can control the speed, pause to examine a specific period, or reset to 1880 and watch it unfold again. The shift from the pre-1950 baseline to the 2000s–2020s is obvious — and it gets more obvious as the particle behavior changes.

## Color encoding

| Anomaly | Color |
|---------|-------|
| Below 0°C | Ice blue |
| 0°C – 0.5°C | Warm white/yellow |
| Above 0.5°C | Deep red to orange |

## Controls

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Speed slider | 0.1x to 2.0x playback |
| Play/Pause | Hold on a specific year |
| Reset | Restart from 1880 |
| ? button | About modal with data links |

## Updating the data

NASA publishes updated monthly figures. To pull the latest:

```bash
curl -s "https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv" > nasa-data.csv
```

## Data source

[NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4)](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
Dataset: `GLB.Ts+dSST.csv` — global mean surface temperature anomalies, monthly, 1880–present.

## Running locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Opening `index.html` directly may hit CORS restrictions on the CSV. Use the server.
